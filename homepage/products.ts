    title: 'Rose Gold Finish Refillable Pen',
    description: 'The iridescent body shimmers like dragon scales in shifting light, revealing hidden depths of color with every turn. Hints of emerald, sapphire, and amethyst dance across its surface, as if imbued with enchantments beyond mortal understanding. The rose gold accents, warm as the last light of a setting sun, lend a regal contrast—an artifact fit for a master of both magic and words. To hold one is to wield a relic of both elegance and power, a writing instrument worthy of inscribing spells… or simply signing ones name with a flourish.',
